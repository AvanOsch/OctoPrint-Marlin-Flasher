Adds the ability to easily update your Arduino based printer firmware with just a few clicks directly through OctoPrint.
You can install multiple libraries if your firmware needs it, upload your firmware code, and just hit Flash.

Please be aware that I'm not responsible for any damage made to your printer if something had to go wrong during the flashing process.

**See** the [README](https://github.com/Renaud11232/OctoPrint-Marlin-Flasher/blob/master/README.md) for more information on how to configure and use this plugin
